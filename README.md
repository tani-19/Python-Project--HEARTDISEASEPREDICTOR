Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on several medical parameters using machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to build an accurate model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals early.

Features:
-Data preprocessing and cleaning of a heart disease dataset
-Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms
-Feature selection and scaling
-Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
-Visualization of data and results
-Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

Technologies Used:
-Python 3.x
-Pandas: for data manipulation
-NumPy: for numerical operations
-Matplotlib & Seaborn: for data visualization
-Scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms
-Jupyter Notebook: for development and experimentation

Machine Learning Models:
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Trees
-Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset which contains the following features:
-Age
-Sex
-Chest pain type (4 values)
-Resting blood pressure
-Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
-Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
-Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
-Maximum heart rate achieved
-Exercise-induced angina
-Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
-Thalassemia
